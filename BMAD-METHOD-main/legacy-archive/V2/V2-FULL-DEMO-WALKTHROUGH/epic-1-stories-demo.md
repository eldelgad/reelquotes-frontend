Okay, transitioning to **SM Mode**.

I will now generate the stories for **Epic 1: Project Initialization & Core Setup**, as requested for demonstration purposes.

I will use the details from Epic 1 in `combined-artifacts-for-posm.txt`, the `story-template.txt`, and extract relevant technical context from the supporting documents (`architecture.txt`, `project-structure.txt`, `tech-stack.txt`, `environment-vars.txt`, `testing-strategy.txt`).

**Note:** As identified during PO Mode validation, Story 1.2 contained a requirement to install the `dotenv` package [111-112], which contradicts multiple other documents stating native Node.js support is used and the package is unnecessary (`ENV` [549], `ARCH` [72], `TS` [867], `PRD` [752]). The following story for 1.2 has been generated based on the **correction** that the `dotenv` package is **not required** and native Node.js functionality should be used.

Here is the report containing the generated stories for Epic 1:

# Story 1.1: Initialize Project from Boilerplate

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up the initial project structure using the `bmad-boilerplate`, so that I have the standard tooling (TS, Jest, ESLint, Prettier), configurations, and scripts in place. [96]

**Context:** This is the foundational story for the entire project. It establishes the core development environment, tooling, and standard scripts based on the `bmad-boilerplate` template, as required by the PRD [706, 713, 784] and Architecture [43]. All subsequent development relies on the successful completion of this setup.

## Detailed Requirements

- Copy or clone the contents of the `bmad-boilerplate` into the new project's root directory. [97]
- Initialize a git repository in the project root directory (if not already done by cloning). [98]
- Ensure the `.gitignore` file from the boilerplate is present. [99]
- Run `npm install` to download and install all `devDependencies` specified in the boilerplate's `package.json`. [100]
- Verify that the core boilerplate scripts (`lint`, `format`, `test`, `build`) execute without errors on the initial codebase. [101]

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The project directory contains the files and structure from `bmad-boilerplate`. [102]
- AC2: A `node_modules` directory exists and contains packages corresponding to `devDependencies`. [103]
- AC3: `npm run lint` command completes successfully without reporting any linting errors. [104]
- AC4: `npm run format` command completes successfully, potentially making formatting changes according to Prettier rules. [105] Running it a second time should result in no changes. [106]
- AC5: `npm run test` command executes Jest successfully (it may report "no tests found" which is acceptable at this stage). [107]
- AC6: `npm run build` command executes successfully, creating a `dist` directory containing compiled JavaScript output. [108]
- AC7: The `.gitignore` file exists and includes entries for `node_modules/`, `.env`, `dist/`, etc. as specified in the boilerplate. [109, 632]

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create/Copy: All files from `bmad-boilerplate` (e.g., `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc.js`, `.gitignore`, initial `src/` structure if any).
  - Files to Modify: None initially, verification via script execution.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` [813-825] for the target overall layout derived from the boilerplate)._
- **Key Technologies:**
  - Node.js 22.x [851], npm [100], Git [98], TypeScript [846], Jest [889], ESLint [893], Prettier [896].
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` [839-905] for full list)._
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - N/A for this story.
- **Data Structures:**
  - N/A for this story.
- **Environment Variables:**
  - N/A directly used, but `.gitignore` [109] should cover `.env`. Boilerplate includes `.env.example` [112].
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` [548-638] for all variables)._
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Ensure boilerplate scripts (`lint`, `format`) run successfully. [101]
  - Adhere to ESLint/Prettier rules defined in the boilerplate. [746]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Obtain the `bmad-boilerplate` content (clone or copy).
- [ ] Place boilerplate content into the project's root directory.
- [ ] Initialize git repository (`git init`).
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` exists and is correctly sourced from boilerplate.
- [ ] Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- [ ] Execute `npm run lint` and verify successful completion without errors.
- [ ] Execute `npm run format` and verify successful completion. Run again to confirm no further changes.
- [ ] Execute `npm run test` and verify successful execution (no tests found is OK).
- [ ] Execute `npm run build` and verify `dist/` directory creation and successful completion.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** N/A for this story (focus is project setup). [915]
- **Integration Tests:** N/A for this story. [921]
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify file structure matches boilerplate (AC1).
  - Check for `node_modules/` directory (AC2).
  - Run `npm run lint` (AC3).
  - Run `npm run format` twice (AC4).
  - Run `npm run test` (AC5).
  - Run `npm run build`, check for `dist/` (AC6).
  - Inspect `.gitignore` contents (AC7).
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` [907-950] for the overall approach)._

# Story 1.2: Setup Environment Configuration

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish the environment configuration mechanism using `.env` files, so that secrets and settings (like output paths) can be managed outside of version control, following boilerplate conventions and utilizing native Node.js support. [110, 549]

**Context:** This story builds on the initialized project (Story 1.1). It sets up the critical mechanism for managing configuration parameters like API keys and file paths using standard `.env` files, which is essential for security and flexibility. It leverages Node.js's built-in `.env` file loading [549, 867], meaning **no external package installation is required**. This corrects the original requirement [111-112] based on `docs/environment-vars.md` [549] and `docs/tech-stack.md` [867].

## Detailed Requirements

- Verify the `.env.example` file exists (from boilerplate). [112]
- Add an initial configuration variable `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH=./output` to `.env.example`. [113]
- Create the `.env` file locally by copying `.env.example`. Populate `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` if needed (can keep default). [114]
- Implement a utility module (e.g., `src/utils/config.ts`) that reads environment variables **directly from `process.env`** (populated natively by Node.js from the `.env` file at startup). [115, 550]
- The utility should export the loaded configuration values (initially just `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH`). [116] It is recommended to include basic validation (e.g., checking if required variables are present). [634]
- Ensure the `.env` file is listed in `.gitignore` and is not committed. [117, 632]

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: **(Removed)** The chosen `.env` library... is listed under `dependencies`. (Package not needed [549]).
- AC2: The `.env.example` file exists, is tracked by git, and contains the line `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH=./output`. [119]
- AC3: The `.env` file exists locally but is NOT tracked by git. [120]
- AC4: A configuration module (`src/utils/config.ts` or similar) exists and successfully reads the `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` value **from `process.env`** when the application starts. [121]
- AC5: The loaded `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` value is accessible within the application code via the config module. [122]
- AC6: The `.env` file is listed in the `.gitignore` file. [117]

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `src/utils/config.ts`.
  - Files to Modify: `.env.example`, `.gitignore` (verify inclusion of `.env`). Create local `.env`.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` [822] for utils location)._
- **Key Technologies:**
  - Node.js 22.x (Native `.env` support >=20.6) [549, 851]. TypeScript [846].
  - **No `dotenv` package required.** [549, 867]
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` [839-905] for full list)._
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - N/A for this story.
- **Data Structures:**
  - Potentially an interface for the exported configuration object in `config.ts`.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` [498-547] for key project data structures)._
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Reads `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` from `process.env`. [116]
  - Defines `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` in `.env.example`. [113]
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` [559] for this variable)._
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - `config.ts` should export configuration values clearly.
  - Consider adding validation logic in `config.ts` to check for the presence of required environment variables on startup. [634]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Verify `bmad-boilerplate` provided `.env.example`.
- [ ] Add `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH=./output` to `.env.example`.
- [ ] Create `.env` file by copying `.env.example`.
- [ ] Verify `.env` is included in `.gitignore`.
- [ ] Create `src/utils/config.ts`.
- [ ] Implement logic in `config.ts` to read `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` directly from `process.env`.
- [ ] Export the loaded `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` value from `config.ts`.
- [ ] (Optional but Recommended) Add validation in `config.ts` to ensure `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` is defined in `process.env`.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Write unit tests for `src/utils/config.ts`. [915]
  - Use `process.env` manipulation (e.g., temporarily setting `process.env.OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` within the test) to verify the module reads and exports the value correctly.
  - Test validation logic (e.g., if it throws an error when a required variable is missing). [920]
- **Integration Tests:** N/A for this story. [921]
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Check `.env.example` content (AC2).
  - Verify `.env` exists locally but not in git status (AC3, AC6).
  - Code inspection of `src/utils/config.ts` (AC4).
  - Later stories (1.3, 1.4) will consume this module, verifying AC5 implicitly.
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` [907-950] for the overall approach)._

## Story Wrap Up (Agent Populates After Execution)

- **Agent Model Used:** `<Agent Model Name/Version>`
- **Completion Notes:** {Implemented using native Node.js .env support, no external package installed. Added basic validation.}
- **Change Log:**
  - Initial Draft (Corrected requirement to use native .env support instead of installing `dotenv` package).

# Story 1.3: Implement Basic CLI Entry Point & Execution

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic `src/index.ts` entry point that can be executed via the boilerplate's `dev` and `start` scripts, providing a working foundation for the application logic. [123]

**Context:** This story builds upon the project setup (Story 1.1) and environment configuration (Story 1.2). It creates the main starting point (`src/index.ts`) for the CLI application. This file will be executed by the `npm run dev` (using `ts-node`) and `npm run start` (using compiled code) scripts provided by the boilerplate. It verifies that the basic execution flow and configuration loading are functional. [730, 755]

## Detailed Requirements

- Create the main application entry point file at `src/index.ts`. [124]
- Implement minimal code within `src/index.ts` to:
  - Import the configuration loading mechanism (from Story 1.2, e.g., `import config from './utils/config';`). [125]
  - Log a simple startup message to the console (e.g., "BMad Hacker Daily Digest - Starting Up..."). [126]
  - (Optional) Log the loaded `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` from the imported config object to verify config loading. [127]
- Confirm execution using boilerplate scripts (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run start`). [127]

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: The `src/index.ts` file exists. [128]
- AC2: Running `npm run dev` executes `src/index.ts` via `ts-node` and logs the startup message to the console. [129]
- AC3: Running `npm run build` successfully compiles `src/index.ts` (and any imports like `config.ts`) into the `dist` directory. [130]
- AC4: Running `npm start` (after a successful build) executes the compiled code from `dist` and logs the startup message to the console. [131]
- AC5: (If implemented) The loaded `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` is logged to the console during execution via `npm run dev` or `npm run start`. [127]

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `src/index.ts`.
  - Files to Modify: None.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` [822] for entry point location)._
- **Key Technologies:**
  - TypeScript [846], Node.js 22.x [851].
  - Uses scripts from `package.json` (`dev`, `start`, `build`) defined in the boilerplate.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` [839-905] for full list)._
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - N/A for this story.
- **Data Structures:**
  - Imports configuration object from `src/utils/config.ts` (Story 1.2).
  - _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` [498-547] for key project data structures)._
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Implicitly uses variables loaded by `config.ts` if the optional logging step [127] is implemented.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` [548-638] for all variables)._
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use standard `import` statements.
  - Use `console.log` initially for the startup message (Logger setup is in Story 1.4).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create the file `src/index.ts`.
- [ ] Add import statement for the configuration module (`src/utils/config.ts`).
- [ ] Add `console.log("BMad Hacker Daily Digest - Starting Up...");` (or similar).
- [ ] (Optional) Add `console.log(\`Output directory: \${config.OUTPUT_DIR_PATH}\`);`
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` and verify console output (AC2, AC5 optional).
- [ ] Run `npm run build` and verify successful compilation to `dist/` (AC3).
- [ ] Run `npm start` and verify console output from compiled code (AC4, AC5 optional).

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** Low value for this specific story, as it's primarily wiring and execution setup. Testing `config.ts` was covered in Story 1.2. [915]
- **Integration Tests:** N/A for this story. [921]
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Verify `src/index.ts` exists (AC1).
  - Run `npm run dev`, check console output (AC2, AC5 opt).
  - Run `npm run build`, check `dist/` exists (AC3).
  - Run `npm start`, check console output (AC4, AC5 opt).
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` [907-950] for the overall approach)._

# Story 1.4: Setup Basic Logging and Output Directory

**Status:** Draft

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic console logging mechanism and the dynamic creation of a date-stamped output directory, so that the application can provide execution feedback and prepare for storing data artifacts in subsequent epics. [132]

**Context:** This story refines the basic execution setup from Story 1.3. It introduces a simple, reusable logger utility (`src/utils/logger.ts`) for standardized console output [871] and implements the logic to create the necessary date-stamped output directory (`./output/YYYY-MM-DD/`) based on the `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` configured in Story 1.2. This directory is crucial for persisting intermediate data in later epics (Epics 2, 3, 4). [68, 538, 734, 788]

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement a simple, reusable logging utility module (e.g., `src/utils/logger.ts`). [133] Initially, it can wrap `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`. Provide simple functions like `logInfo`, `logWarn`, `logError`. [134]
- Refactor `src/index.ts` to use this `logger` for its startup message(s) instead of `console.log`. [134]
- In `src/index.ts` (or a setup function called by it):
  - Retrieve the `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` from the configuration (imported from `src/utils/config.ts` - Story 1.2). [135]
  - Determine the current date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format (e.g., using `date-fns` library is recommended [878], needs installation `npm install date-fns --save-prod`). [136]
  - Construct the full path for the date-stamped subdirectory (e.g., `${OUTPUT_DIR_PATH}/${formattedDate}`). [137]
  - Check if the base output directory exists; if not, create it. [138]
  - Check if the date-stamped subdirectory exists; if not, create it recursively. [139] Use Node.js `fs` module (e.g., `fs.mkdirSync(path, { recursive: true })`). Need to import `fs`. [140]
  - Log (using the new logger utility) the full path of the output directory being used for the current run (e.g., "Output directory for this run: ./output/2025-05-04"). [141]
- The application should exit gracefully after performing these setup steps (for now). [147]

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: A logger utility module (`src/utils/logger.ts` or similar) exists and is used for console output in `src/index.ts`. [142]
- AC2: Running `npm run dev` or `npm start` logs the startup message via the logger. [143]
- AC3: Running the application creates the base output directory (e.g., `./output` defined in `.env`) if it doesn't already exist. [144]
- AC4: Running the application creates a date-stamped subdirectory (e.g., `./output/2025-05-04`, based on current date) within the base output directory if it doesn't already exist. [145]
- AC5: The application logs a message via the logger indicating the full path to the date-stamped output directory created/used for the current execution. [146]
- AC6: The application exits gracefully after performing these setup steps (for now). [147]
- AC7: `date-fns` library is added as a production dependency.

## Technical Implementation Context

**Guidance:** Use the following details for implementation. Refer to the linked `docs/` files for broader context if needed.

- **Relevant Files:**
  - Files to Create: `src/utils/logger.ts`, `src/utils/dateUtils.ts` (recommended for date formatting logic).
  - Files to Modify: `src/index.ts`, `package.json` (add `date-fns`), `package-lock.json`.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/project-structure.md` [822] for utils location)._
- **Key Technologies:**
  - TypeScript [846], Node.js 22.x [851], `fs` module (native) [140], `path` module (native, for joining paths).
  - `date-fns` library [876] for date formatting (needs `npm install date-fns --save-prod`).
  - _(Hint: See `docs/tech-stack.md` [839-905] for full list)._
- **API Interactions / SDK Usage:**
  - Node.js `fs.mkdirSync`. [140]
- **Data Structures:**
  - N/A specific to this story, uses config from 1.2.
  - _(Hint: See `docs/data-models.md` [498-547] for key project data structures)._
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Uses `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` loaded via `config.ts`. [135]
  - _(Hint: See `docs/environment-vars.md` [559] for this variable)._
- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Logger should provide simple info/warn/error functions. [134]
  - Use `path.join` to construct file paths reliably.
  - Handle potential errors during directory creation (e.g., permissions) using try/catch, logging errors via the new logger.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Install `date-fns`: `npm install date-fns --save-prod`.
- [ ] Create `src/utils/logger.ts` wrapping `console` methods (e.g., `logInfo`, `logWarn`, `logError`).
- [ ] Create `src/utils/dateUtils.ts` (optional but recommended) with a function to get current date as 'YYYY-MM-DD' using `date-fns`.
- [ ] Refactor `src/index.ts` to import and use the `logger` instead of `console.log`.
- [ ] In `src/index.ts`, import `fs` and `path`.
- [ ] In `src/index.ts`, import and use the date formatting function.
- [ ] In `src/index.ts`, retrieve `OUTPUT_DIR_PATH` from config.
- [ ] In `src/index.ts`, construct the full date-stamped directory path using `path.join`.
- [ ] In `src/index.ts`, add logic using `fs.mkdirSync` (with `{ recursive: true }`) inside a try/catch block to create the directory. Log errors using the logger.
- [ ] In `src/index.ts`, log the full path of the created/used directory using the logger.
- [ ] Ensure the script completes and exits after these steps.

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test `src/utils/logger.ts` functions (can spy on `console` methods). [915]
  - Test `src/utils/dateUtils.ts` function for correct date formatting.
  - Testing `fs` operations in unit tests can be complex; consider focusing on integration or manual verification for directory creation. Mocking `fs` is an option but might be brittle. [918]
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Could write a test that runs the core logic of `src/index.ts` (directory creation part) and uses `mock-fs` or actual file system checks (with cleanup) to verify directory creation. [921, 924]
- **Manual/CLI Verification:**
  - Run `npm run dev` or `npm start`.
  - Check console output uses the logger format (AC1, AC2).
  - Verify the base output directory (e.g., `./output`) is created if it didn't exist (AC3).
  - Verify the date-stamped subdirectory (e.g., `./output/2025-05-04`) is created (AC4). Use current date. Delete directories before re-running to confirm creation.
  - Check console log for the message confirming the output directory path (AC5).
  - Confirm the process exits cleanly (AC6).
  - Check `package.json` for `date-fns` dependency (AC7).
- _(Hint: See `docs/testing-strategy.md` [907-950] for the overall approach)._
