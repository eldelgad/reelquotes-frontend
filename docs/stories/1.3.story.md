Story 1.3: Scaffold the Subtitle Acquisition & Processing API and CI/CD Pipeline
Status: Approved
Story
As a Developer,
I want a foundational NestJS application for the subtitle processing API, created in its own repository with an automated Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline,
so that I have a stable, consistent, and quality-controlled environment to build the data ingestion logic.
Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
A new public GitHub repository named reelquotes-subtitle-api exists.
The repository contains a new NestJS application initialized using the NestJS CLI.
The application runs successfully on a local machine in development mode using the command npm run start:dev.
A GitHub Actions workflow file is present at the path .github/workflows/ci.yml.
The CI workflow is automatically triggered on every push to any branch in the repository.
The CI workflow includes steps to install dependencies, run the linter (npm run lint), and run the default test suite (npm run test).
The CI workflow must complete successfully for the initial commit.
Tasks / Subtasks
(Tasks are identical to Story 1.2, but applied to the reelquotes-subtitle-api repository).

[ ] Create GitHub Repository: Create reelquotes-subtitle-api.
[ ] Clone Repository.
[ ] Initialize NestJS Application using nest new . and selecting npm.
[ ] Verify Default Setup with npm install and npm run test.
[ ] Create CI Workflow file at .github/workflows/ci.yml.
[ ] Define CI Workflow Steps (Node.js setup, install, lint, test).
[ ] Commit and Push Initial Project with a message like "feat: initial project scaffold for subtitle api with NestJS and CI setup".
[ ] Verify CI Run in the repository's "Actions" tab.
Dev Technical Guidance
Technology Stack: This story implements foundational choices from the Architecture Document. The core technologies are Node.js and NestJS. Jest and GitHub Actions are the selected tools for testing and CI/CD respectively.
Coding Standards: The initial ESLint and Prettier configurations set up by the NestJS CLI will serve as the baseline for our Coding Standards.
