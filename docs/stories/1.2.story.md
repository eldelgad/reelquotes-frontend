Story 1.2: Scaffold the Main Backend API and CI/CD Pipeline
Status: Approved
Story
As a Developer,
I want a foundational NestJS application for the main backend API, created in its own repository with an automated Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline,
so that I have a stable, consistent, and quality-controlled environment to start building API features.
Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
A new public GitHub repository named reelquotes-main-api exists.
The repository contains a new NestJS application initialized using the NestJS CLI.
The application runs successfully on a local machine in development mode using the command npm run start:dev.
A GitHub Actions workflow file is present at the path .github/workflows/ci.yml.
The CI workflow is automatically triggered on every push to any branch in the repository.
The CI workflow includes steps to install dependencies, run the linter (npm run lint), and run the default test suite (npm run test).
The CI workflow must complete successfully for the initial commit.
Tasks / Subtasks
[ ] Create GitHub Repository:
Create a new public GitHub repository named reelquotes-main-api.
Initialize it with a README file.
[ ] Clone Repository:
Clone the newly created reelquotes-main-api repository to your local machine.
[ ] Initialize NestJS Application:
Navigate into the repository's directory.
Run the NestJS CLI command to create a new project in the current directory:
Bash

nest new .
When prompted by the CLI, select npm as the package manager to maintain consistency.
[ ] Verify Default Setup:
Run npm install to ensure all dependencies are installed.
Run npm run test to verify that the default testing setup (using Jest) is working correctly.
[ ] Create CI Workflow:
Create the directory path .github/workflows/.
Inside that directory, create a new file named ci.yml.
[ ] Define CI Workflow Steps:
Populate ci.yml with the necessary YAML configuration for a GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow should:
Trigger on push to all branches.
Use a Node.js environment (e.g., version 20.x).
Include a step to cache npm dependencies.
Include a step to run npm ci to install dependencies.
Include a step to run the linter: npm run lint.
Include a step to run the tests: npm run test.
[ ] Commit and Push Initial Project:
Add all the generated and created files to Git.
Create an initial commit with a message like "feat: initial project scaffold for main backend api with NestJS and CI setup".
Push the commit to the main branch of the reelquotes-main-api repository on GitHub.
[ ] Verify CI Run:
Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository to confirm that the CI workflow was triggered by the push and that all steps completed successfully.
Dev Technical Guidance
Technology Stack: This story implements foundational choices from the Architecture Document. The core technologies are Node.js and NestJS. Jest and GitHub Actions are the selected tools for testing and CI/CD respectively.
Coding Standards: The initial ESLint and Prettier configurations set up by the NestJS CLI will serve as the baseline for our Coding Standards.
