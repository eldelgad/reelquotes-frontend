Story 1.4: Define and Deploy Foundational AWS Infrastructure via CDK
Status: Approved
Story
As a Developer,
I want the core cloud infrastructure, including the network and Elasticsearch cluster, defined as code and deployed to AWS,
so that our backend services have a stable, private environment and a database to connect to for development and testing.
Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
A new public GitHub repository named reelquotes-infra is created and contains an AWS CDK project initialized in TypeScript.
The CDK project defines a new AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) with both public and private subnets across at least two Availability Zones.
The CDK project defines a managed Amazon OpenSearch Service (Elasticsearch compatible) cluster.
The OpenSearch cluster is configured with an access policy that makes it accessible only from within the defined VPC, not from the public internet.
The CDK project includes a CI/CD pipeline definition using GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/deploy.yml) capable of deploying the CDK stacks.
The infrastructure (VPC and OpenSearch cluster) is successfully deployed to the staging AWS environment by the CI/CD pipeline after merging to the main branch.
The connection endpoint for the OpenSearch cluster and its associated security group ID are exposed as stack outputs for use by our backend services.
Tasks / Subtasks
[ ] Create Infrastructure Repository:
Create a new public GitHub repository named reelquotes-infra.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
[ ] Initialize AWS CDK Project:
Navigate into the repository's directory.
Run the AWS CDK CLI command to initialize a new project using TypeScript:
Bash

cdk init app --language typescript
[ ] Define Networking Stack (VPC):
In the lib/ directory, create a new CDK stack file for the network.
In this stack, define a new ec2.Vpc resource. Configure it to create public and private subnets across two Availability Zones for high availability.
[ ] Define Database Stack (OpenSearch):
Create another new CDK stack file for the database.
In this stack, define a new opensearch.Domain resource.
Configure the domain with a small instance type suitable for MVP (e.g., t3.small.search).
Set the access policy to only allow access from within the VPC created in the previous step.
Enable Fine-Grained Access Control and create a master user, storing the credentials securely in AWS Secrets Manager.
[ ] Instantiate Stacks:
In the main CDK application file (e.g., bin/reelquotes-infra.ts), instantiate both the networking and database stacks.
[ ] Create Deployment Workflow (CI/CD):
Create the directory path .github/workflows/.
Inside that directory, create a new file named deploy.yml.
[ ] Define Deployment Workflow Steps:
Populate deploy.yml with the necessary YAML configuration. The workflow should:
Trigger on push to the main branch.
Configure AWS credentials securely (using GitHub secrets for access keys or OIDC).
Install dependencies (npm ci).
Build the TypeScript project (npm run build).
Run cdk bootstrap (if the environment is new).
Run cdk deploy --all --require-approval never to deploy both stacks non-interactively.
[ ] Commit and Push Infrastructure Code:
Add all the CDK project files and the new workflow file to Git.
Create an initial commit with a message like "feat: define foundational VPC and OpenSearch cluster via CDK".
Push the commit to the main branch of the reelquotes-infra repository.
[ ] Verify Deployment:
Check the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository to ensure the deployment workflow ran and succeeded.
Log in to the AWS staging account console to verify that the VPC, its subnets, and the Amazon OpenSearch domain have been created successfully.
Dev Technical Guidance
Technology Stack: This story implements the infrastructure choices from the Architecture Document: AWS as the cloud provider, AWS CDK as the IaC tool, and Amazon OpenSearch Service for our Elasticsearch cluster.
VPC Configuration: Ensure the VPC has an Internet Gateway for the public subnets and NAT Gateways for the private subnets to allow outbound internet access if needed by services in the future.
Security: This is a security-critical story. Ensure the OpenSearch access policies and VPC security groups are configured correctly to prevent public access. Do not commit any credentials or secrets to the Git repository.
